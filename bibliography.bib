abstract = {In this paper we describe an artificial immune system (AIS) which is based upon models of the natural immune system. This natural system is an example of an evolutionary learning mechanism which possesses a content addressable memory and the ability to «forget» little-used information. It is also an example of an adaptive non-linear network in which control is decentralized and problem processing is efficient and effective. As such, the immune system has the potential to offer novel problem solving methods. The AIS is an example of a system developed around the current understanding of the immune system. It illustrates how an artificial immune system can capture the basic elements of the immune system and exhibit some of its chief characteristics. We illustrate the potential of the AIS on a simple pattern recognition problem. We then apply the AIS to a real-world problem: the recognition of promoters in DNA sequences. The results obtained are consistent with other appproaches, such as neural networks and Quinlan's ID3 and are better than the nearest neighbour algorithm. The primary advantages of the AIS are that it only requires positive examples, and the patterns it has learnt can be explicitly examined. In addition, because it is self-organizing, it does not require effort to optimize any system parameters.}
