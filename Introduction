Algorithms and systems that draw inspiration from the human immune system are known as artificial immune systems (AIS) as all AIS algorithms imitate the characteristics and behavior of immune cells, particularly B-cells, T-cells, and dendritic cells (DCs), the resulting algorithms vary in complexity and are capable performing a variety of tasks. The human immune system is a resilient, decentralized, adaptive, and error-tolerant mechanism. Such characteristics are quite useful while creating new computer systems. Because different algorithms implement distinct attributes of different cells, the discipline of AIS spans a range of methods, unlike certain other bio-inspired techniques like genetic algorithms and neural networks
